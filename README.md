##### This is a project for Mathematical Introduction to Manipulators class.
##### What we were required to do is programing the QKM manipulator to catch a table tennis ball and throw it accurately into a small hoop
##### Ten balls in a round and the whole process is automatic and without human intervention. We got nine points out of ten in the end.
### project progress

### Trajectory planning
##### Apply the trapezoidal trajectory planning.
##### Doing trajectory planning in joint space directly so that we can avoid multipleÂ solutions while calculating inverse.
##### To avoid overspeed, trajectories are first visualized in MATLAB
